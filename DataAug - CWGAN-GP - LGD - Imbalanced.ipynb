Thus, this left 9 samples of the majority and 27 of the minority class to be the test sets. This was made by putting the set of 36 samples of a class into 4 folds of 9, combining 3 for the majority class for the training set. This split happenned before data pre-treatment. Then both sets were independently trained with the same pre-treatment pipeline but on the test set we performed a 'faux' Pareto scaling using the features standard deviation and mean of the training set. The training and test sets have (in most cases) a vastly different balance of class samples. Thus, feature averages and standard deviations can be quite different between them, especially in key features for discrimination. To compensate for this, the ‘faux’ Pareto scaling was applied. The untreated training sets were linearly augmented, which was then treated (using a normal Pareto scaling, in this case), to generate samples to train the CWGAN-GP models.\n",
